Introduction

When searching for Earth-like planets around F, G, and K-type stars, pressure-mode (P-mode) oscillations, 
caused by global acoustic waves in the stellar interior, induce RV variations on the m/s scale, 
potentially masking Earth-like planetary signals (cm/s). Mitigating these oscillations is crucial for the 
RV follow-up of potentially habitable exoplanets and can be done by tuning exposure times to stellar parameters.

For Sun-like stars, P-mode oscillations occur over a narrow frequency range. They can, therefore, be averaged 
out to reduce the error in the RV measurements. Chaplin et al. (2019), which used the stellar parameters to estimate 
the RV amplitude, observed that the P-mode signal does not monotonically decrease with time, further emphasising 
the need to determine the optimal exposure time to remove the P-mode noise.

Exposure Time Evaluation for Mitigation of P-mode Oscillations (ExTEMPO)

ExTEMPO is a tool which can be used to develop a p-mode mitigation strategy by optimising the exposure times of 
radial velocity observations. It uses the stellar parameters such as mass, radius, effective temperature, log luninousity, 
nu_max and delta_nu to determine the P-mode rms amplitude at different exposure times for solar-like stars 
(F,G and K stars).

ExTEMPO utilises stellar scaling relations to model the PSD of the p-mode oscillations.
